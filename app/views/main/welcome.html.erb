                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Understanding Tokens</h2>

                <p class="mb-4"><span class="text-lg font-bold">> Tokens are the key to unlocking our AI's creative potential.</span> Each token allows you to generate one AI image. As a warm welcome, new users receive 10 free tokens to start exploring this feature!</p>

                <p class="mb-4"><span class="text-lg font-bold">> Need more tokens?</span> Easily purchase additional ones by clicking the tokens icon in the navbar or directly from your dashboard. Remember, it's just 1 token per AI image.</p>

                <p class="mb-4"><span class="text-lg font-bold">> Creating an effective image prompt is simple.</span> For example, "a cartoon cat playing with a ball of yarn under a sunny sky" provides clear, descriptive elements for the AI to visualize. The more detailed your description, the more accurate the AI-generated image will be.</p>

                <p class="mb-4"><span class="text-lg font-bold">> And remember, using IttyBittyBoards doesn't require any tokens.</span> You can always upload your own images for free to create personalized communication boards.</p>
