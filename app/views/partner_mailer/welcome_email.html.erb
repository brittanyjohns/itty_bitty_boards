            <p>Hi <strong><%= @user.name %></strong>,</p>

            <p>
              I'm so excited to officially welcome you to the
              <strong>SpeakAnyWay Pilot Partner Program</strong>! 💜
              You're part of a small, hand-picked group helping us shape what this program —
              and this community — will become.
            </p>

            <p>
              These first rounds are pilots, which means a few things might shift or improve along the way.
              Thank you for being flexible, curious, and open with your feedback as we grow together.
              We truly couldn't do this without you.
            </p>

            <p><strong>You're officially in — let's dive in!</strong></p>

            <hr style="border:none; border-top:1px solid #eeeeee; margin:24px 0;" />

            <h3>💡 Getting Oriented: Your Accounts</h3>

            <p><strong>Communicator Accounts</strong> → Used for speech access and AAC boards.</p>
            <p>
              Create one for each communicator (like a child or student), set a simple passcode,
              and track their progress from any device.
            </p>

            <p><strong>MySpeak Accounts</strong> → Optional profiles linked to a Communicator.</p>
            <p>
              These store ICE (In Case of Emergency) details, contacts, and safety info.
              Each includes a scannable QR code and connects seamlessly to the communicator's boards.
            </p>

            <p>
              Together, these accounts show how SpeakAnyWay combines
              <strong>communication + safety</strong> in one system.
            </p>

            <p>
              Check out our Etsy shop for printable AAC resources, ID tags, stickers, tattoos & more!
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>3 Communicator Accounts are included</strong> — if you need more,
              please just let us know.
            </p>

            <p>
              ♾️ Do you currently have any students or clients who need AAC but don't have access
              or have limited access? Please reach out — we would love to work with you to help
              get them what they need. 🫶
            </p>

              and the official feedback form:
