      2. Group words by parts of speech (e.g., pronouns, verbs, adjectives).
      3. Consider how speech-language pathologists arrange words for ease of use in communication, ensuring frequently used words are near the top left.
      4. Use a grid layout with a MAXIMUM of #{num_of_columns} columns and MAX rows: #{max_num_of_rows}.
      5. Each entry should include the word, its grid position as [x, y], its part of speech, its size, and its frequency of use.
      6. The size of each word should be based on its frequency of use, with high-frequency words being larger. Size is represented as number of grid spaces the word occupies. [1,1] is a single grid space. [2,2] is a 2x2 grid space. & so on.
      7. Do not overlap words or exceed the grid size.
